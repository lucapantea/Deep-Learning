    Inputs:
        decoder - Decoder model such as LinearDecoder or ConvolutionalDecoder.
        grid_size - Number of steps/images to have per axis in the manifold.
                    Overall you need to generate grid_size**2 images, and the distance
                    between different latents in percentiles is 1/grid_size

    ## Hints:
    # - You can use the icdf method of the torch normal distribution  to obtain z values at percentiles.
    # - Use the range [0.5/grid_size, 1.5/grid_size, ..., (grid_size-0.5)/grid_size] for the percentiles.
    # - torch.meshgrid might be helpful for creating the grid of values
    # - You can use torchvision's function "make_grid" to combine the grid_size**2 images into a grid
    # - Remember to apply a softmax after the decoder
